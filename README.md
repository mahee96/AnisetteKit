# AnisetteKit

A high-performance, on-device Anisette Data generator and ADI emulation library for **iOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS** via Swift Package Manager.

---

## Background

`AnisetteKit` is built on top of foundational ideology behind **Sidestore's** `omnisette-server` and uses **unicorn-engine's** `linux elf64 emulation` to achieve self-contained on-device authentication:

- **[SideStore/omnisette-server](https://github.com/SideStore/omnisette-server)**: Originally demonstrated that ADI shared libraries (`libstoreservicescore.so` and `libCoreADI.so`) could be executed in an AArch64 Linux environment to provision and generate valid Anisette authentication data. However, `omnisette-server` required deploying and maintaining a remote Linux server or Docker container, introducing network latency, hosting overhead, and server dependencies.
- **[Unicorn Engine (TCI)](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn)**: A lightweight, multi-platform CPU emulator. By leveraging Unicorn compiled with the Tiny Code Interpreter (TCI) backend into multi-platform XCFrameworks, `AnisetteKit` executes the Linux AArch64 binaries inside an in-process virtual machine. This enables seamless, zero-server execution directly on iOS, tvOS, and visionOS without requiring JIT entitlements or debug servers.

---

## Features

- **Full On-Device Execution**: Runs entirely local on device.
- **NO Servers Required**: Completely eliminates the need for remote or external Anisette servers.
- **Custom TCI Engine for Unicorn**: Powered by our custom Tiny Code Interpreter (TCI) implementation added to Unicorn Engine (`-DUNICORN_ENABLE_TCI=ON`), enabling pure C bytecode interpretation of Linux AArch64 binaries across iOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS without JIT.
- **NO JIT-Entitlement / Debug-Server Required**: Runs on iOS, tvOS, and visionOS devices without requiring JIT entitlements, debug servers, or W^X kernel violations.
- **Native Host Execution on macOS**: Runs Linux AArch64 binaries directly on ARM64 host CPUs via in-process memory mapping for fastest header generation.

## Public API Reference

### `LocalAnisetteProvider`

#### `init(provisioningDir:clientInfo:libraryDirectoryResolver:) throws`
* **When to use**: Initializes the provider, resolves the `.so` directory via closure, and validates required binaries.
* **Parameters**:
  * `provisioningDir`: Directory `URL` where persistent device provisioning state (`adi.pb`) is saved.
  * `clientInfo`: Apple client identification string (defaults to `defaultClientInfo`).
  * `libraryDirectoryResolver`: Closure returning the directory `URL` containing required `.so` binaries.

#### `validateLibrariesExist(at:) -> Bool`
* **When to use**: Pre-flight validation before initialization to verify `libstoreservicescore.so` and `libCoreADI.so` exist in the specified directory `URL`.
* **Parameters**:
  * `directory`: Filesystem `URL` to inspect.

#### `getHeaders(identifier:) async throws -> [String: String]`
* **When to use**: Standard production header generation (Native on macOS, Unicorn TCI on iOS/tvOS/visionOS).
* **Parameters**:
  * `identifier`: Persistent device `UUID`.
* **Returns**: Dictionary containing all required Anisette HTTP headers.

#### `getHeadersUC(identifier:) async throws -> [String: String]`
* **When to use**: Explicitly forces Unicorn TCI CPU emulation on all platforms (diagnostics, testing, or benchmarking).
* **Parameters**:
  * `identifier`: Persistent device `UUID`.
* **Returns**: Dictionary containing all required Anisette HTTP headers.

### Types & Constants

* **`LibraryDirectoryResolver`**: `() throws -> URL` closure type for supplying runtime `.so` directory.
* **`LocalAnisetteHeaders`**: Structure containing decoded headers (`machineID`, `oneTimePassword`, `routingInfo`, `date`).
* **`LocalAnisetteError`**: Typed errors (`librariesNotFound`, `loaderFailed`, `symbolMissing`, `adiError`, `invalidArgument`).
* **`requiredLibraryNames`**: `["libstoreservicescore.so", "libCoreADI.so"]`.
* **`defaultClientInfo`**: Default client identification string for Apple GrandSlam services.
* **`defaultRoutingInfo`**: Default routing identifier (`"17106176"`).
* **`defaultLocalUserID`**: Default local user ID representation.
